Week 5 Project:
   Building off of week 4, we will now be storing the user's favorited items in the Firebase Database.
   Modify your code so that your list of "favorited" user items is stored (i.e, you can refresh the page and they stay there!)
   Once you accomplish this, post your website online using firebase hosting!
