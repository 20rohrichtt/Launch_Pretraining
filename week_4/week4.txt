Week 4 Project:
   From week 3, we should have the ability for users to store a type of food that they want to eat in state.
   Now, we are going to modify the "submit" button so that once clicked, it will return a list of restaurants
   in the users area for their specified type of food. We will be using google's place api to accomplish this:
   https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/search . In order to use this, you first need to get a search api key
   from google. The implementation of this is left a bit vague because there are multiple ways to accomplish this! The page should then
   display a list of restaurants nearby (hint: use the map function!). The user should be able to "favorite" selected items
   in this list.
