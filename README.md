## Expectations

Participants are expected to attend the meetings each week. If more than four absences are recorded, there is a risk of not completing the program and discontinuing membership with HackCville, so if you feel you’re at risk here, please talk to an instructor to evaluate your situation so we can try to work something out.

## Week 1: Overview of Git, Node, and the Terminal

Although not the most flashy, Git and the Terminal two of the most important tools that develops need to know. Git is a software that allows us to control versions of our code and allows us to collaborate with others, while the Terminal is the "home base" from which we will navigate our computer files and run code.

## Week 2: Introduction to React

We will touch quickly on several more advanced topics that in Javascript that are crucial when we start working in React, such as mapping and certain special types of function calls.

## Week 3: Introduction to React, Cont.

This is where the fun begins! We will start to make web applications in React, going over the fundamentals and all the necessary components.

## Week 4: HTTP/API Requests

Take a deeper dive into react and start applying some of the advanced javascript techniques that we learned during Week 2. Chances are, you will often need to interact with something else (like a database) outside of its own codebase. We’ll go over how to make your code “wait” while it’s pulling from these resources and how to do so using HTTP requests, which make up the bulk of how computers talk to each other over the Internet.

## Week 5: Firebase

We’ve come to love JSON’s, right? Well, we’ll be looking at an online database that’s literally structured like a giant JSON! We’ll go over the basics of using Firebase to read/write data online and briefly touch on some of the other functionality it has (login systems have NEVER been easier).

## Week 6: The Wonderful World of Node_Modules

Why write code that someone _probably_ has already written before? We will take a deeper dive into node package manager this week and take a look at all of the
cool packages that you can install to make your life as a React developer easier.

## Week 7: Wrap-up/Presentations

The last meeting will be reserved for groups to present on their final project. This will be a good opportunity to practice presenting technical information in a professional, real-world
