Week 3 Project:
    Now that we know how to manage state from user input, create a text field in the main component of the app 
    that allows users to enter  what type of food they are in the mood for (italian, mexican etc.). Have this update an entry in 
    state called "foodType". In addition, add a "submit" button adjacent to the user input that, on click, will check if the 
    "foodType" entry in state is a valid input (not empty, and not mispelled--one way to accomplish this is to create an array
    of types of food and see if the user input is within the array)--if the input is not valid, push an alert to the screen that says
    "Invalid Entry!" (this might be helpful: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_alert.asp)
