Week 6 Project:

This week is all about making your all look pretty! At this point all the functionality *should*
be in place, so take some artistic liberty to clean up the design, using any node_module design library 
(it doesn't have to be limited to anything we discussed in class). In addition, next week each group will
be doing presentations on their project--plan to talk for about 5 minutes, talking about what libraries and technologies
your group used, potential faults in your application, what you would like to add if you had more time, etc...
Although this may seem redundant as many of our groups will have used the same technologies,
this is a good opportunity to practice presenting on technical information in a professional setting.
