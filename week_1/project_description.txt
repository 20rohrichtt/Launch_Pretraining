Launch Pretraining Project Description
----
A small indie company called "Apple" has contracted you to help in the development of their new
state-of-the-art food service platform called "Foodie Finder". The application will allow users log in,
search for food in their area by category (italian, mexican, etc...), and then save their restauarants to
their account that they "favorite".
