Week 1 Project:
    This first week's exercise will be to create a github account, have one member in your group create a repository for our course-long project, and then have each member
    of the group clone the repository, edit the README.md file by adding their name to it, and push the changes to github.
    This repository will serve as the foundation for which we build out our project for the rest of the class!
